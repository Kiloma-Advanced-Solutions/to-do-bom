## Day 1: Project Setup, Authentication & Authorization

### Lecture

**Topics:**
- Introduction to the Task Management Application
- Project setup and structure
- Implementing authentication and authorization

**Details:**
We'll start by setting up our Next.js project and configuring it to use TypeScript. We'll then implement user authentication using NextAuth.js and set up role-based authorization.

### Instructions

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Initialize a new Next.js project:
     ```bash
     npx create-next-app@latest to-do-bom
     ```
  
   - Configure project structure.

2. **Authentication & Authorization:**
   - Install NextAuth.js:
     ```bash
     npm install next-auth
     ```
   - Create sign-up and login pages.
   - Define user roles (admin, user) and protect routes based on roles.

### Tasks

1. Initialize the project and configure TypeScript.
2. Set up the project structure with pages, components, and styles.
3. Create the Sign Up page with a form and integrate it with the sign-up API.
4. Create the Login page with a form and integrate it with the login API.
5. Implement role-based route protection.

## Day 2: Middleware, Cookies & Local Storage

### Lecture

**Topics:**
- Middleware in Next.js
- Managing sessions with cookies
- Storing user preferences with local storage

**Details:**
Today, we'll implement middleware for request handling and validation, manage user sessions with cookies, and store user preferences using local storage.

### Instructions

1. **Middleware:**
   - Create middleware for logging request details.
   - Implement request validation middleware.
   - Use middleware to protect sensitive routes.

2. **Cookies & Local Storage:**
   - Manage sessions using cookies.
   - Save and retrieve user preferences with local storage.
   - Create a settings page for user preferences.

### Tasks

1. Create logging and request validation middleware.
2. Protect sensitive routes with middleware.
3. Implement session management with cookies.
4. Save preferences in local storage and create a settings page.

## Day 3: Task Management, Caching & Static/SSR Components

### Lecture

**Topics:**
- Implementing task management
- Caching strategies
- Static generation, SSR, and client components in Next.js

**Details:**
We'll build the core functionality of our application by implementing task management features, use caching to improve performance, and explore static generation, SSR, and client-side rendering.

### Instructions

1. **Task Management:**
   - Create task model and API routes.
   - Implement task creation, editing, and deletion.
   - Develop client-side components for task forms and lists.

2. **Caching:**
   - Implement caching with SWR or React Query.

3. **Static/SSR Components:**
   - Use static generation for public pages.
   - Implement SSR for user-specific pages.
   - Create client components for interactive elements.

### Tasks

1. Create task model and implement API routes for task operations.
2. Develop components for task creation, editing, and listing.
3. Implement caching for task data using SWR or React Query.
4. Use static generation for the home page and SSR for the dashboard.

## Day 4: Image Optimization, ISR & i18n

### Lecture

**Topics:**
- Optimizing images
- Implementing Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- Adding internationalization (i18n) support

**Details:**
We'll optimize images for better performance, implement ISR for dynamic content, and add multi-language support to our application.

### Instructions

1. **Image Optimization:**
   - Use Next.js Image component for optimized image loading.

2. **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR):**
   - Implement ISR for dynamic content.

3. **Internationalization (i18n):**
   - Add multi-language support.

### Tasks

1. Use the Next.js Image component for image optimization.
2. Implement ISR for dynamic content.
3. Add i18n support for multiple languages.

## Day 5: Dynamic Imports, Error Handling, SEO Optimization & Final Review

### Lecture

**Topics:**
- Dynamic imports for code splitting
- Error handling in Next.js
- SEO optimization techniques
- Final review and deployment

**Details:**
We'll implement dynamic imports for code splitting and lazy loading, handle errors gracefully, optimize the application for SEO, and review and deploy the application.

### Instructions

1. **Dynamic Imports:**
   - Implement code splitting and lazy loading with dynamic imports.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement error boundaries and custom error pages.

3. **SEO Optimization:**
   - Techniques for improving SEO with Next.js.

4. **Final Review & Deployment:**
   - Review the application.
   - Deploy to a hosting service.
   - Discuss next steps and potential improvements.

### Tasks

1. Implement code splitting and lazy loading with dynamic imports.
2. Create error boundaries and custom error pages.
3. Apply SEO optimization techniques.
4. Review and test the entire application.
5. Deploy the application and verify the deployment.
